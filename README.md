# Paragraph-Processor-Word-Finder
The task is to create a backend program that can accept multiple paragraphs as a single input. Each paragraph should be stored in a table, and every word in the paragraphs should be mapped with the paragraph ID in another table. The program should then be able to return the top 10 paragraphs that contain the specific word.
